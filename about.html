            <p>
                
            My name is Rose Manga, a Gambian by nationalism. And age of 23. I am a creative designer who love to do, things that will always impress and make people happy. Reading is also a hobby.
            
            web developming is something that i was curious of, and imagination of its criticalness to make it look how ever you desire drive me more crazy. As the saying goes, curiosity kills the cat, but it does not kill students, instead it makes them to learn and know things they have never known before.
